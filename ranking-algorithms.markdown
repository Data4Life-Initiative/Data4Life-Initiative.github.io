# Personal Risk Ranking

Risk scoring will be localised depending on the region/country. The platform is configurable during onboarding or via admin functions. 

## Risk analysis comments

A holistic risk management is needed to empower the individual, SME, & society based upon their own risk scenarios and risk tolerance, not controlled by those of a ministry.  There are risks to health everytime we step out of our house and even while we are in our house. 

ISO 31000:2009 gives a list on how to deal with risk:

* Avoiding the risk by deciding not to start or continue with the activity that gives rise to the risk
* Accepting or increasing the risk in order to pursue an opportunity
* Removing the risk source
* Changing the likelihood
* Changing the consequences
* Sharing the risk with another party or parties
* Retaining the risk by informed decision

## Scoring Methodology
Risk scoring is a 10 point scale, based on the following. Please note that this is done now for hackathon to demonstrate the solution. This personal risk ranking method shall be customisable depending on the country and area authorities.
